# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to provide visual analysis of the performance of a rideshare company (PyBer), and its drivers, across three different city types - urban, suburban, and rural. We used data from January 2019 - April 2019. The starting data consisted of two separate CSVs (city data and ride data). These two files were merged to create one DataFrame which consisted of:

 - City name
 - Date and Time of ride
 - Driver ID
 - Total drivers in city
 - City type (urban, suburban or rural)

Once this DataFrame had been created we were able to conduct analysis to create a summary DataFrame containing the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver.

## Results

The summary DataFrame shows there were 2,375 rides taken between January and April of 2019. Urban cities accounted for most rides, 68% of the total rides taken. The lowest was the rural areas, only accounting for 5% of the total trips.

There is a similar story with the total fares. 63% of total fares were in urban cities and rural was the lowest with 7%.

From this information, we can see that the service is used much more frequently in urban areas. This will undoubtedly be due to the higher populations in urban areas.

When we look at the average fare per ride, it is apparent that the costs to use the service are higher in suburban areas and even more so in rural areas. There is a difference of over $10 in average fares per ride between the rural cities and urban cities. The likely cause of this is the distance between destinations. Urban areas are more compact and require less mileage per trip. Rural areas tend to be more spread out, thus requiring more driving per trip.

We can also see it is financially beneficial for drivers to be operating in the rural areas as they make an average fare of $55.49. The urban areas are considerably less at $16.57 per driver. Not knowing the mileage of trips makes it difficult to know how beneficial rural areas are because we don't know how much is being spent on gas.

## Summary

Based on the evidence displayed I would make the following recommendations to maximize business performance:

 - Due to there being a surplus of drivers in urban areas I would suggest implementing some incentives for drivers to relocate to            suburban areas. This will increase the number of drivers in suburban areas and could allow some drivers from suburban areas to move to    rural areas. This can lead to more drivers in the areas with low numbers without the need for extra recruitment.
 - Increase advertising/promotions in urban areas. For example, a loyalty scheme in which the customer can receive a discount after 5 rides.
 - Experiment with increasing pricing in urban areas. A small addition to the per-mile cost can yield high returns due to the high volume of rides in the area.
